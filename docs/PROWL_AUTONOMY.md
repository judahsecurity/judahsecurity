# Prowl scheduled autonomy pilot

Prowl's existing tester process remains the assessment engine. A schedule with
`config.autonomous_followup: true` now enqueues one durable work item per target
and due time. The `autonomy-worker` service claims one item, runs one bounded
agent turn, saves its redacted engagement state in Postgres, and queues another
turn only when the saved hypothesis graph has new work. Other schedules keep
their existing execution path.

## Enable in AWS

1. Apply `db/migrations/add_agent_autonomy_work.sql`, deploy the backend and
   scanner images, and start `autonomy-worker` alongside `scheduler`. The SQL
   also adds the lease turn timestamp to an existing work table; `create_all`
   only creates missing tables.
2. Configure the same database, AI provider, RoE, egress IP, and assessment
   proxy settings used by Prowl's existing agent. Confirm the worker is healthy
   before enabling a schedule.
3. On a `tester_process` schedule, enable autonomous follow-up. The schedule
   config may also set `max_turns` (default 3, cap 4), `price_limit_usd`
   (default 8), `max_total_seconds` (default 3600, cap 7200),
   `max_specialist_tool_calls` (default 12, cap 40),
   `max_specialist_seconds` (default 300, cap 600), and
   `max_parallel_specialists` (default 3, cap 6). The saved work contract also
   accepts `allowed_hosts`, `allowed_identities`, `allowed_actions` (`read`,
   `probe`, `state_change`), `max_specialist_requests`,
   `specialist_interval_ms`, `max_parallel_tool_calls`,
   `max_specialist_spend_usd`, `max_recon_tool_starts`, and
   `request_rate_per_second`. Extra hosts must pass the current RoE check.
4. Query `GET /api/v1/scan-schedules/{id}/autonomy-work` for work status,
   turns, spend, recon leads, open hypotheses, verified candidates, and stop
   reason. A lead is not a verified finding.
5. Open the schedule's timeline button, or query
   `GET /api/v1/scan-schedules/{id}/autonomy-work/{work_id}/timeline`, to see
   observations, linked hypotheses, specialist attempts, evidence references,
   verdicts, stop reasons, and reported cost without raw tool logs.

The opted-in early recon pack adds a bounded CNAME lookup. DNS, live hosts,
technologies, API endpoints, and first-party scripts enter a shared observation
contract with a target, source, timestamp, evidence reference, scope, and
dedupe key. The takeover scanner saves compatible CNAME events; a scheduled
hunt imports recent in-scope scanner events. One observation produces one
deduplicated specialist hypothesis. Prowl's existing proof checks still decide
whether a candidate is verified.

The worker resumes queued turns after a restart using the Postgres snapshot.
For an expired in-flight lease, it checks the action ledger and a newer costed
snapshot. Only completed read-only work with a new continuation revision is
requeued. Missing receipts, actionful tools, or an unknown spend are explicitly
blocked for operator reconciliation. Disabling the schedule or autonomous
follow-up prevents a queued item from starting.

The per-specialist contract enforces tool starts, identity names in structured
arguments, explicit URL hosts, action class, elapsed time, and parallel tool
calls. Common recon CLIs also receive a request-rate flag. A CLI can still
issue several outbound requests inside one tool start, and a model call can
exceed a reported dollar threshold before usage is returned. Keep the feature
opted in until an AWS pilot confirms the actual request and provider spend
envelopes; use the existing bounded pilot request gate when strict per-request
accounting is required.

## Offline benchmark

Run `PYTHONPATH=backend python backend/scripts/benchmark_autonomy_handoffs.py`.
The checked-in fixture uses non-routable, sanitized NanoClaw patterns and
current Prowl regression controls. It measures asset, endpoint, and hypothesis
lead recall plus extra leads without target traffic. Candidate recall,
receipt-backed verified recall, false positives, requests, time, and spend
remain `null` until AWS pilot outcomes are supplied with `--results`. The
results JSON accepts a `cases` array with `id`, `candidates`,
`verified_candidates`, `false_positives`, `requests`, `time_seconds`, and
`spend_usd`. Use the timeline and verified count from Prowl for those results.
Keep the schedule flag off by default; compare pilot results before considering
a default-on release.
